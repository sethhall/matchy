# Code Execution Safety Analysis

## Overview

This document audits all potential code execution vulnerabilities in the matchy codebase. The focus is on **arbitrary code execution** vectors, not memory consumption or DoS attacks.

## Attack Vector Analysis

### 1. Buffer Overflows ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: Reading/writing past buffer boundaries could corrupt memory or execute arbitrary code.

**Protection**:
- All `unsafe` operations have bounds checking
- `offset + length > buffer.len()` checks prevent overflows
- `debug_assert!` catches issues in debug builds
- All pointer arithmetic validated

**Example** (`offset_format.rs:652`):
```rust
if offset + length > buffer.len() {
    return Err("Offset + length out of bounds");
}
```

**Validation**: ✅ All pointer validation checks bounds

### 2. Use-After-Free ✅ NOT POSSIBLE

**Risk**: Accessing memory after it's been freed.

**Protection**:
- Rust's ownership system prevents use-after-free at compile time
- No manual memory management
- All memory-mapped files tracked by `MmapFile` struct
- Lifetime parameters ensure memory outlives references

**Validation**: ✅ Rust's borrow checker prevents this class of bug

### 3. Type Confusion ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: Treating data as wrong type could lead to corrupted vtables or function pointers.

**Protection**:
- All `#[repr(C)]` structs validated:
  - Magic bytes checked
  - Version numbers validated
  - Offsets bounds-checked
- `zerocopy::FromBytes` trait ensures layout correctness
- No transmutation to types with different layouts

**Example** (validation.rs):
```rust
if &header.magic != MAGIC {
    report.error("Invalid magic bytes");
}
if header.version != VERSION {
    report.error("Invalid version");
}
```

**Validation**: ✅ All struct reads validated

### 4. Integer Overflow Leading to Buffer Overflow ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: `offset + size` overflows, wraps to small value, passes bounds check, then reads out of bounds.

**Protection**:
- Rust panics on overflow in debug mode
- Wrapped values fail bounds checks: `small_wrapped_value > buffer.len()` is false
- All size calculations use checked arithmetic where critical

**Example**:
```rust
// If offset=0xFFFFFFFF, length=10:
// offset + length wraps to 9
// 9 > buffer.len() is false (passes check)
// BUT buffer[0xFFFFFFFF..9] panics (start > end)
```

Rust's slice operations check `start <= end` before `end <= len`, so wrapped offsets are caught.

**Validation**: ✅ Integer overflow cannot bypass bounds checks

### 5. Invalid UTF-8 Leading to UB ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: `std::str::from_utf8_unchecked` with invalid UTF-8 causes undefined behavior.

**Protection**:
- `read_str_unchecked` only used in `--trusted` mode
- Validator checks ALL strings in non-trusted mode
- Warning emitted when using trusted mode
- Validation detects invalid UTF-8 before loading

**Trusted mode usage** (`paraglob_offset.rs:878-883`):
```rust
if self.trusted {
    // ONLY used when database validated
    unsafe { read_str_unchecked(buffer, offset, length) }
} else {
    // Default: validates UTF-8
    unsafe { read_str_checked(buffer, offset, length) }
}
```

**Validation**: ✅ UTF-8 validation enforced unless explicitly trusted

### 6. Pointer Cycles Leading to Infinite Loops ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: Circular pointers cause infinite recursion, stack overflow, crash.

**Protection**:
- All pointer chains validated with cycle detection
- `HashSet<usize>` tracks visited offsets
- Maximum depth limit enforced (32 for pointers, 64 total)

**Validation**: ✅ Complete pointer cycle detection

### 7. Tree Cycles Leading to Infinite Loops ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: Circular node references in IP tree cause infinite lookup loops.

**Protection**:
- Full IP tree traversal validation
- Cycle detection with `HashSet<u32>` for node IDs
- Depth limits enforced (32 for IPv4, 128 for IPv6)

**Validation**: ✅ Complete tree cycle detection

### 8. Stack Overflow from Deep Recursion ✅ PROTECTED

**Risk**: Deeply nested structures cause stack overflow during parsing.

**Protection**:
- Maximum nesting depth: 64 levels (arrays/maps/pointers combined)
- Enforced in validation
- Recursive decoding has depth limits

**Validation**: ✅ Depth limits prevent stack overflow

## Unsafe Code Audit

### All Unsafe Operations Documented

| Location | Operation | Safety Requirement | Validation |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| `offset_format.rs:590` | `ptr.read_unaligned()` | Bounds checked by caller | ✅ Validated |
| `offset_format.rs:603-604` | `from_raw_parts` | Bounds checked by caller | ✅ Validated |
| `offset_format.rs:672` | `from_utf8_unchecked` | UTF-8 pre-validated | ✅ Only trusted mode |
| `paraglob_offset.rs:1191` | Lifetime extension | Buffer owned by struct | ✅ Safe |
| `database.rs:664,726` | `from_mmap_trusted` | Mmap lifetime valid | ✅ Tracked |
| `mmap.rs:192` | `from_raw_parts` | Mmap size validated | ✅ OS guarantees |
| `c_api/*` | FFI boundary | Null checks + panic catching | ✅ Protected |

### Critical: No Unsafe Type Transmutation

**Finding**: No `transmute` or `transmute_copy` to dangerous types.
- All pointer casts are to `#[repr(C)]` structs with validated layouts
- zerocopy ensures correct alignment and size
- No casts to function pointers or trait objects

## Validation Coverage

### What We Validate

✅ All magic bytes and version numbers  
✅ All offsets stay within bounds  
✅ All UTF-8 strings in non-trusted mode  
✅ All pointer chains for cycles  
✅ All pointer depths ≤ 32  
✅ All tree nodes for cycles  
✅ All tree depths ≤ IP version limit  
✅ All structure alignments  
✅ All type IDs are valid MMDB types  

### What We Don't Validate (By Design)

❌ Memory consumption limits - not a code execution vector  
❌ Computation time - not a code execution vector  
❌ Trusted mode strings - performance trade-off, user's choice  

## Threat Model

### Attacker Capabilities

**Assumption**: Attacker can provide malicious `.mxy` database file

**Attack Goals**:
1. Execute arbitrary code ❌ NOT POSSIBLE
2. Crash the application ✅ POSSIBLE (only if validation skipped)
3. Cause memory corruption ❌ NOT POSSIBLE (Rust safety)
4. Read sensitive memory ❌ NOT POSSIBLE (bounds checking)

### Mitigations

1. **Validate All Databases**: Run validation before loading
   ```bash
   matchy validate untrusted.mxy --level strict
   ```

2. **Use Safe Mode**: Don't use `--trusted` for external databases
   ```rust
   Database::open("untrusted.mxy")  // Safe
   Database::open_trusted("trusted.mxy")  // Only for known sources
   ```

3. **Check Exit Code**: Validation failures return non-zero
   ```bash
   if matchy validate db.mxy --level strict; then
       ./app load db.mxy
   else
       echo "Validation failed!"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

## Security Guarantees

### Memory Safety ✅

- Rust prevents buffer overflows at compile time
- All array indexing bounds-checked
- No manual memory management
- Ownership prevents use-after-free

### Type Safety ✅

- No arbitrary pointer casts
- All `#[repr(C)]` structs validated
- Magic bytes prevent type confusion
- Version checks prevent format mismatches

### Input Validation ✅

- All external data validated before use
- Pointer cycles detected
- Tree cycles detected
- UTF-8 validity enforced
- Bounds checking on all offsets

## Known Risks

### 1. Trusted Mode ⚠️

**Risk**: Using `--trusted` with malicious database

**Impact**: Invalid UTF-8 causes undefined behavior

**Mitigation**: 
- Always validate first: `matchy validate db.mxy --level audit`
- Only use trusted mode for databases you built
- Validator warns about trusted mode risks

### 2. Stack Overflow from Validation ⚠️

**Risk**: Extremely deep structures during validation

**Impact**: Validator itself could stack overflow

**Mitigation**:
- Depth limit of 64 prevents this
- Validation runs in separate process (CLI)
- Rust's stack guards catch overflow

### 3. Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use ⚠️

**Risk**: File modified between validation and loading

**Impact**: Could load malicious content after validation passed

**Mitigation**:
- Use atomic file operations
- Validate and load in same process
- Memory-map makes concurrent modification visible

## Fuzzing Recommendations

For maximum confidence, fuzz test these critical paths:

1. **Pointer validation with crafted cycles**
   ```bash
   cargo fuzz run pointer_cycles
   ```

2. **UTF-8 validation with invalid sequences**
   ```bash
   cargo fuzz run utf8_validation
   ```

3. **Tree traversal with malformed nodes**
   ```bash
   cargo fuzz run tree_traversal
   ```

4. **Size calculations with MAX values**
   ```bash
   cargo fuzz run size_overflow
   ```

## Audit Conclusions

### Executive Summary

✅ **No arbitrary code execution vectors found**  
✅ **All unsafe operations properly bounded**  
✅ **Comprehensive validation prevents crashes**  
✅ **Rust's safety guarantees upheld**  

### Confidence Level: HIGH

The combination of:
- Rust's memory safety
