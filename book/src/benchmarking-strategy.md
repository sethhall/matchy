# Benchmarking Strategy

Strategy and methodology for benchmarking Matchy.

## Benchmark Goals

1. **Measure real-world performance** - Realistic workloads
2. **Track regressions** - Detect performance degradation
3. **Compare approaches** - Evaluate optimizations
4. **Guide optimization** - Identify bottlenecks

## Benchmark Categories

### Build Performance

Measure database construction time:
- Time to insert entries
- Memory usage during build
- Serialization overhead

### Load Performance

Measure database loading:
- mmap overhead
- Validation time
- Memory footprint

### Query Performance

Measure lookup speed:
- Queries per second (QPS)
- Average latency
- P50, P95, P99 latencies
- Cache effects

## Methodology

### Realistic Data

- Use production-like patterns
- Mix of hits and misses
- Varied query complexity

### Stable Environment

- Consistent hardware
- Minimal background load
- Multiple iterations
- Warm-up runs

### Statistical Rigor

- Measure multiple runs
- Report mean and variance
- Account for outliers
